When the program starts and the main routine is run,
at first x is initialized to 4. Then x gets passed to the function A.
This function increments x by one so x is 5 now. So the first output is:
  5
The next call of A does not change x, because it only works on a copy of x.
In the call of function B the address of x is passed as an argument.
However this address is then changed to 10, but only in the scope of function B.
Thus the next output again gives:
  5
In function C again the address of x is passed as an argument.
This time the passed pointer gets dereferenced an thus the value of x gets set
to 6. So the last output gives:
  6
