I chose the nano editor.
To save the file:     Ctrl+O
To exit the editor:   Ctrl+X

To paste some text:   Ctrl+U (Only copied or cut text from within nano)
Also to paste from Clipboard one can use the mechanism implemented in whichever shell one is using.
In my case this is rightclick.
To copy a line:       Alt+6
Search for a word:    Ctrl+W; "Search String"; Enter
