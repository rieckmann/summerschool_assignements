For working on these assignements I am using a Windows 10 machine running Debian through the Windows Subsystems for Linux.
I installed the WSL using this guide: 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Furthermore I installed Xming for GUI interaction with the Linux OS.

I did not have to install a package manager, since debian is shiped with apt.
However I used the 
  $sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade 
  $sudo apt-get install build-essential 
commands to update the System.
Having later Assignements in mind I also installed cmake, git and to be sure gdb using:
  $sudo apt-get install cmake git gdb
After that I confirmed my gcc, git, make and cmake installation with  
  $gcc -v
  $git --version
  $make -v
  $cmake --version
Additionaly I installed the Atom Text Editor using the following commands:
  $sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https //was not on the system required to download atom
  $wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
  $sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list' 
  $sudo apt-get update
  $sudo apt-get install atom
To be able to have a graphical interface I used the following hack:
  $cd usr/share/atom/
  $sudo cp  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 . 
  $sudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' libxcb.so.1           
Then I edited the .bashrc and added the line:
  export Display=:0
Now after starting the debian shell the display gets exported and by running Xming I am able to interact with the GUI.
That was that for setting up my System up to this point.

Then I went on and opened a repository on github, cloned it to my local machine, where i created some folder structure.
I then configured my usersettings, added and commited the changes and pushed it back to the github repository:
  $git  clone https://github.com/rieckmann/summerschool_assignements.git
  $git add -A
  $git config --global user.name "rieckmann"
  $git config --global user.email "fakemail@fake.com"
  $git commit -a -m "Some commit message"
  $git push origin master
