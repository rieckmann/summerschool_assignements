Path of default login directory:
  /svr/home/mrieckmann

When I Login bash is running.

Two flags i could pass to the ls command:
  -a: Show hidden files
  -R: List the contents of subdirectories, repeat for there subdirectories and so on
  
There are 1041 lines in /proc/cpuinfo

Using:
  $module load gcc
  $module show
Reveals that the loaded gcc version is 8.2.0
However looking through the modules with
  $module avail  
One can find, that the latest installed version of gcc is 9.1.0
