# summerschool_assignments

All code for the assignments is shipped with a makefile.
To compile and run you can use:
  $ make run_taskname (append arguments like n=someinteger)

If you compile the code without make please make sure to use the c99 standard,
as the code contains some loops, that won't work in the default euler gcc/latest
module.
