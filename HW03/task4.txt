1)
Unit Testing
In Unit Testing single modules of code get tested.
For example a single function, to determine if it is working correctly.
2)
Integration Testing
Integration Testing is the next step after Unit Testing, to determine if
multiple modules or parts of code work correctly together.
3)
Functional Testing
In Functional Testing it is determined, whether a whole part of a program
fulfills is function.
4)
End-to-end Testing
End-to-end Testing takes place to ensure the software as a whole fulfills its
function, in a way from start to end.
5)
Performance Testing
Performance Testing as the name suggests tests the performance of the software.
This includes stability, reliability and scalability of the software.
6)
Usability Testing
This is pretty self-explanatory as it tests the usability of a system
for its potential users.
7)
Acceptance Testing
This test ensures the requirements of the software
i.e. as specified in a contract are met.
8)
Beta Testing
Beta Testing describes the process to test the software in a
live deployment situation, where it is used by end-users.

9) Validation Testing
In a sense this is equivalent to Acceptance Testing but from a
software development viewpoint. Acceptance Testing is to ensure the end-user
requirements are met, while Validation Testing asks from the development
viewpoint, whether we are developing the right product to meet these
requirements.
