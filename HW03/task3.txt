a)
What is the size of variable p on Euler?
8 Byte
b)
What is the address of p ?
0x7ffffffee308
c)
What is the address of c ?
0x7ffffffee307
d)
What is the value of arr[0] after the assignment on line 16?
266
e)
What is the value of arr[0] at the end of the program?
266
f)
Explain why the value of arr[0] changes
Because arr[0] stores an int with size 4 Bytes, lets mark them x x x x
Now we take p which points to arr[0] as a char (size 1 Byte) pointer
and change its second value. What we get for arr[0] is thus x c x x
